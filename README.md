## Declaration
We declare that we have written this assignment code ourselves. We have taken assistance from the following sources:

OpenGL documentation and tutorials
GLM library documentation
GLFW documentation
Stack Overflow for specific OpenGL debugging
Course lecture materials and tutorial code

also use some-place to debug claude-ai like some where my VAOs doesn't store attribute in correct way


## to compile and run our code
```bash
make
```
then
```bash
./modeler
or
make run
```

```bash
    type command as given below
```

## 3D Modeler Application
### Press M for Modelling mode, I for Inspection mode. Esc to quit.

    X/Y/Z: Select axis
    +/-: Apply transform
    C: Change color
    S: Save model

### Inspection Mode:
    L: Load model
    R: Rotate entire model
    X/Y/Z: Select axis
    +/-: Apply rotation

## Snapshot

## Some bugs
    like if we saved our code in .mod file still not able to save in exact transformation
